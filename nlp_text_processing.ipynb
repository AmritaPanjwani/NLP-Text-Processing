For exampl: \"medical document\" is a phrase with two words, it can be considered as 1 single feature by countvectorizer if ngram_range is mentioned as(1,2). This allows the countvectorizer to take all unigrams and bigrams as features.\n",
    "- token_patthern: it takes a string value, it tells what kind of tokens can be considered. Default token pattern to denote a word is: r”(?u)\\b\\w\\w+\\b”\n",
    "- stop_words: it takes a string which denotes language like 'english'. This tells countvectorizer to remove all stop_words\n",

If binary: true, this will count only presence or absence of a word in a sentence. Presence is captured as 1 and absence is captured as 0.

In this case, the assignment of 0 and 1 would be exactly same for both sentences, which makes it look that two sentences are similar. These vectors are very close to each other.
